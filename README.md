# Project #2: Full Stack Application

## Overview:

You will be creating a full stack application using NodeJS and NoSQL.

---

## What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in, and reviewed, many of the big themes of the course so far:

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with objects, constructors, events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- **Web Fundamentals**: Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style, and animate documents within a browser. Also learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- **Browser Applications**: Dive into CSS, and figure out how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style and functionality for free.
- **Deployment**: Host a static web site in a managed hosting environment.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Making web applications that respond to device size.
- **Server Side Applications**: Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website.
- **Databases**: A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
- **NoSQL**: "not only SQL," database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data, an alternative to traditional relational databases in which data is placed in tables. Data schema is carefully designed before the database is built.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript programming fundamentals including Object Oriented Programming with Classes and Inheritance.
- **NodeJS and Express**: A web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
- **Mongodb**: A cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema.
- **Mongoose**: Provides a schema-based solution for object modeling with Node.js to model your Mongodb data.

## Requirements

### General Requirements

- Build a web application from scratch, must be your own work.
- Use Express framework to build your application
- Deploy on Heroku so application is live on the web [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs)
- Create a `README.md` file that explains your app to the world

### Technical Requirements

#### Authentication

- User must be able to sign out

#### 2 extra resources of your choice (other than User)
- User must be able to create a resource
- User must be able to edit a resource
- User must be able to view all resources they created
- User must be able to view a single resource they created
- User must not be able to edit or delete other users' resources

#### Stretch Technical Goals (optional)

- Make application responsive
- Use a 3rd party API with [httparty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty)
- Allow users to upload image files 
- Use a CSS library like [Bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap)
- [Seed database](https://gorails.com/episodes/intro-to-importing-from-csv) from CSV file of data
- Use 3rd party API with [httparty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty)

### Team Requirements

- Every team member must have commits contributing to the project.  
- Pair programming is allowed and should be noted in the commit by using `@github_username` of each student pairing
- No single student should do a majority of the commits.




### Necessary Deliverables
- Projects are due on Thursday, 2nd of April, 2020 at 9.00am!
- You have to fill the [google sheet] with you name, github link and deployed link.
- A **10 minute presentation** in which you answer the following questions:
  - What is the application about?
  - Is there any information you think might help us understand what you built?
  - Demo of application
  - What features did you include?
    - Make sure to explain anything "new" (things that we didn't cover in class)
